## Description
In this project we have built an API for a social network where users can create their own user profile, share their thoughts, add or delete friends, and add or delete reactions to their friend's thoughts. This was achieved with the uses of the following technologies: Express.js (handled routing), MongoDB (Database), and Insomnia (display functionality). Please see the demo video below
